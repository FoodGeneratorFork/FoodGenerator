4 cups all-purpose flour
4 large eggs
1 cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon baking soda
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
For The Whipped Cream Frosting4 cups chilled heavy whipping cream
1 1⁄4 cups powdered sugar
For The Chocolate Glaze4 ounces high-quality bittersweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces
1⁄2 cup heavy whipping cream
1⁄4 cup lyle's golden syrup (*this is imported from britain if you can't find it you can substitute light corn syrup)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract","To make the cake: For a three-layer cake, place one baking rack one-third from the bottom of the oven and the second two-thirds from the bottom.Preheat the oven to 350°.Line the bottom of three 9-inch or two 10-inch pans with parchment paper rounds, grease with butter, and dust with flour (Or spray with Baker's Joy).Combine the butter, water and canola oil in a medium saucepan set over medium heat.In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, cocoa and flour.Pour the butter mixture into the sugar mixture and whisk until smooth.Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, then whisk in the buttermilk.Whisk in the baking soda, salt and vanilla all at once.Transfer the batter to the prepared pans.For a three-layer cake, stagger the cake layers on the oven racks so that no layer is directly over another.Set two layers on one rack and the third on the other.For a 2-layer cake, stagger the layers on the middle rack with one placed more toward the front of the oven and one toward the back.Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.Monitor the layers carefully for doneness; each one may be done at different times.Remove the cakes from the oven and cool on racks for about 15 minutes before inverting onto baking racks.Cool the cakes completely, at least two hours, before frosting.To Make Frosting: Using a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the cream in a large bowl on high speed until soft peaks form.Add the powdered sugar and whip until thoroughly combined.Place one cake layer on a plate and spread some of the frosting over the top.Top with the remaining layers, thickly coating the top and sides of each with frosting.Refrigerate the cake until the whipped cream frosting has stabilized, at least one hour.To Make The Glaze: Place the chocolate in a medium bowl.Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it is very hot and just beginning to steam.Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir until it has melted completely.Stir in the syrup and the vanilla.Pour the glaze into a medium pitcher or measuring cup and let cool for ten minutes.Do not let the glaze sit longer because it will stiffen and become difficult to pour over the cake.Slowly pour the glaze over the cake, ensuring that it covers the top of the cake entirely, but make sure some of the cream frosting shows through the drizzles on the sides. (If the glaze doesn't flow easily over the edge of the cake,don't be afraid to add an extra tablespoon or two of the syrup).Refrigerate the cake until the glaze is set and the whipped cream frosting is firm, at least one hour.Slice the cake with a long serrated knife, dipping it in a tall glass of hot water between each slice.The refrigerated cake will keep for about 2 days. **Please note that the cook time only reflects the time needed to bake the batter. Other time is spent on the frostings etc and there are lots of periods where the cake is resting or cooling."

Add remaining brine ingredients (soy sauce - mace) and stir to combine. Stir in cold water (about 2 cups). Add fish to mixture and enough water to cover fish. If using large salmon fish refrigerate for 2-3 days, if using small fish refrigerate for 1 day.Soak hickory chips overnight in water.To prepare smoker/barbecue: prepare barbecue by heaping briquets on one side of the grill (about 30 for a large grill). Ignite and burn until coals glow and gray ash forms.Set drip pans opposite briquets.Remove fish from brine and wipe dry.Pile hickory chips over briquets. Set top grill in place and coals side over drip pan with vegetable oil or spray with Pam.Set fish over drip pan and cover barbecue, leaving 1-2 vents open to allow smoke to escape.Smoke fish until fish flakes with a fork about 8 minutes per pound. For the large salmon trout it can take up to 2 hours but if using small fish about 45-60 minutes.
